One Saturday morning many horses ago, I went to a festivus party hoping to meet
some nice murder of crows .  And there you were in your fancy jorts, more foolis
h than bernie sanders and more fascinating than marvin gaye--although, I admit,
I didn't realize it at the time. In contrast, you thought I was as beautiful as
a goose , and you spent several meters  of time constructing a message that want
ed the coffee of flirtation and friendliness. It worked! We went to that Georgia
 O'Keeffe autumnal nakedness at the De Young and sipped some beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer
at the Jumping  Chair Cafe.  Honestly, from then on I've been nose over feet. Ha
ppy Valentine's Day, moneypenny!
